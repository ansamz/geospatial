# Grouping Swiss cantons according to their landscape properties


We have various geographical features, elevation, climate, and vegetation. Here's a general approach to help you categorize the Swiss cantons based on their landscape properties:

1. Geographical Features:
   - Alpine Cantons: Group the cantons located in the Swiss Alps, known for their mountainous landscapes, glaciers, and high peaks. This includes cantons such as Valais, Graubünden, Uri, and Bern.
   - Plateau Cantons: Categorize the cantons situated on the Swiss Plateau, which is a relatively flat and rolling landscape. This includes cantons such as Zurich, Bern, Aargau, and Lucerne.
   - Jura Cantons: Group the cantons located in the Jura Mountains, known for their hilly terrain and scenic landscapes. This includes cantons such as Neuchâtel, Jura, and Vaud.

2. Elevation:
   - High Alpine Cantons: Categorize cantons with a significant portion of their territory located at high elevations. This includes cantons such as Valais, Graubünden, and Uri.
   - Lowland Cantons: Group cantons situated in the lower elevations, such as the Swiss Plateau and surrounding areas. This includes cantons such as Zurich, Bern, and Aargau.

3. Climate:
   - Alpine Climate Cantons: Group cantons characterized by an alpine climate with colder temperatures, higher precipitation, and longer winters. This includes cantons such as Valais, Graubünden, and Uri.
   - Continental Climate Cantons: Categorize cantons with a more continental climate, characterized by milder winters and warmer summers. This includes cantons such as Zurich, Bern, and Lucerne.

4. Vegetation:
   - Forested Cantons: Group cantons with extensive forest cover and lush vegetation. This includes cantons such as Graubünden, Bern, and Ticino.
   - Agricultural Cantons: Categorize cantons with a significant portion of their landscape dedicated to agriculture, including farmland and vineyards. This includes cantons such as Zurich, Aargau, and Vaud.
